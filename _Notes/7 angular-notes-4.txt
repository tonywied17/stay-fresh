Angular cont'd
	routing
		allows us to swap components dynamically based on the URL path
		app-routing.module.ts
			contains the path mappings
		<router-outlet></router-outlet>
			specifies WHERE the routed component will show up
		route guards
			ng g guard guard-name
			allow you to set up logic that prevents certain routes from
				being accessed if a certain condition is not met
			for example, an admin guard could restrict the /admin route
