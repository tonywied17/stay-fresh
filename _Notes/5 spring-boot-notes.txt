SpringBoot
	- philosophy: convention over configuration
		- reduce configuration by assuming common conventions
	- a Spring project for making it easier to build enterprise web applications
	- your configuration file with SpringBoot is application.properties or application.yml
		- this is where configurations go that can't be assumed
		- your database connection info
		- JPA dialect
		- etc.
	- the main method class goes in a parent package of everything else (Spring beans)
		- @SpringBootApplication goes at the top of the class
		- in the main method, call SpringApplication.run(CatAppMain.class, args)
		- other things that can go in this class are just general configuration, e.g. CORS configuration
	- DevTools
		- something that can be included with SpringBoot that makes development easier
		- for example, it restarts the server every time you make changes to files
	- actuator
		- gives RESTful endpoints to your application
		- /health, /metrics, /beans, /info, etc.
