Unix
	a family of operating systems. linux and OS X (macOS) are built on unix
	one of the important features of unix is the command-line shell (terminal) for using the OS
		- in linux, this is Bash (bourne again shell)
	about shell commands
		- maneuvering the file system
			- ./ or . references the current directory
			- ../ or .. reference the parent directory
			- ~ references the home directory, usually for the current user
			- / references the root directory
		- flags
			- flags are commonly used to specify different parameters for a command
				- they can mean something on their own or precede a value that you want to set
			- for example, in the following AWS CLI command, "name" and "query" are full flags, marked by "--", with values after
				aws ssm get-parameter --name 'DB_USER' --query 'Parameter.Value'
			- and in the following NPM command, "g" is a short-hand flag, marked by "-", with values for it (it just means global)
				npm install -g @angular/cli
			- shorthand flags can also be stacked together, like in these examples:
				- rm -rf pet-app/
					- remove the petapp folder: recursive (r) and force (f)
				- tar -zxvf tomcat.tar.gz
					- run the compressed tomcat tarball: unzip (z), extract (x), verbose (v), file (f)
		- some important/useful commands
			- man: manual. will give you the manual for a particular command so you know how to use it. (e.g. man cd)
			- cd: change directory
			- ls: list, will list files/directories in the current directory. add the -a flag (all) to see hidden files as well
			- mkdir: make a new folder (directory) in the current directory (e.g. mkdir mynewfolder)
			- touch: make a new, empty file of any kind (e.g. touch newtxtfile.txt)
			- pwd: print working directory - will print the full path of your current directory
			- su: substitute/switch user
			- sudo: run a command as the superuser (root/admin user) (e.g. sudo yum update)
			- echo: print something you specify to the console
			- cat: print a file to the console
			- >: allows you to redirect output to a file, like echo $DB_USER > myfile.txt
			- >>: same as > except it appends output to the end of the file instead of overwriting the whole file
			- grep: print lines of a file that match a particular pattern (regex by default), like grep mysearchtext myfile.txt
			- cp: copy a file/directory to a specified location
			- mv: move a file/directory to a specified location. this can also be used for renaming files/directories
			- rm: remove a file/directory
				- note: cp, mv, and rm must all use the -r (--recursive) flag to be used on directories
	package managers
		- used to install software on unix systems
		- the Amazon Linux AMI that we use on our EC2 instances (the free tier AMI) uses "yum", yellowdog updater
